\# Automated Review Rating System



The \*\*Automated Review Rating System\*\* is a Machine Learning–based project that predicts a product/service rating based on a customer's written review. Instead of manually rating after writing feedback, the system analyzes the text and automatically generates a rating score.



---



\## 📌 Objective

To develop an AI model that:

\- Understands customer reviews (text)

\- Detects sentiment and key expressions

\- Predicts a \*\*rating value (1–5 stars)\*\* automatically



---



\## 🧠 Key Features

✔ Sentiment analysis on review text  

✔ Text preprocessing \& tokenization  

✔ Machine learning model for rating prediction  

✔ Scalable architecture for deployment  

✔ Can be integrated with web apps, e-commerce platforms, feedback systems, etc.
